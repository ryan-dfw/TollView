By Ryan McKevitt & Eric McKevitt

---

## About:

> TollView is an Android mobile application which recognizes when a user drives through a toll gate in the DFW metroplex, alerting the user in realtime of the incurred cost and location via push notification. Every user's history of toll incurrences is logged in a table on the home page, separated by day. This application allows users to effortlessly maintain records of their toll expenditures, thereby eliminating confusion from surprise balances on their cards.

## Implementation: 

- âœ… Firebase Authentication is used to maintain a database of user accounts. 
- âœ… Firebase Realtime Database is used as our cloud-hosted database solution. 
- âœ… Backend is developed in Kotlin, using Android Location Services as a primary dependency. 
- ðŸ•š Jetpack Compose will be used to develop the UI _(Work In Progress)_
